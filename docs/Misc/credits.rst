I would like to thank the developers of Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib for their invaluable contributions to scientific computing in Python.

Most functions were made from equations in Robert D. Zucker and Oscar Biblarz's text "Gas Dynamics". Equations relating to Hypersonic flow are from John Anderson's text "Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics".
