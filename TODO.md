# TODO

Add Fanno flow functions

Add Rayleigh flow functions

Research and add hypersonic information

Setup continuous integration and add unittests

Try to remove scipy.optimize and replace with own function, so entire scipy package doesnt need to be installed.
    but people probably will already have scipy?

Add page to docs with latex formatted equations that represent each function
